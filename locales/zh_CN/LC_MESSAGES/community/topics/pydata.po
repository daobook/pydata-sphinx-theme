"We define CSS rules that ensure PyData content in Sphinx looks reasonable"
" on both light and dark themes. If we hear reports from maintainers that "
"we could change something in this theme that would make their "
"documentation look better, and if this change is sustainable for us, then"
" we should do so."

"`extensions/_execution.scss` - styles for Sphinx libraries that execute "

"go here via generic improvements that all packages benefit from."

"`extensions/_pydata.scss` - styles for specific libraries in the PyData "
