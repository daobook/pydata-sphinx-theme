"Sometimes you want to update configuration values _during a build_. For "
"example, if you want to set a default if the user hasn't provided a "
"value, or if you want to move the value from one keyword to another for a"
" deprecation."

"For example, `app.config.foo = \"bar\"`. For some reason, when Sphinx "
"sets things it directly uses `__dict__`, but this doesn't seem to be "
"different from the pattern described here."

"The `app.config._raw_config` attribute contains all of the **user-"
"provided values**. Use this if you want to check whether somebody has "
"manually specified something. For example, `\"somekey\" in "
"app.config._raw_config` will be `False` if a user has _not_ provided that"
" option."

"This theme is activated **after** `config-inited` is triggered, so if you"
" write an event that depends on it in this theme, then it will never "
"occur. The earliest event you can use is `builder-inited`."
