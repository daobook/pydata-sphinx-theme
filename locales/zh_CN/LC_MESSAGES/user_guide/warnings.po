"Generally speaking, the best source of information about changes to the "
"theme will be the release changelog. We try to avoid raising warnings "
"within theme code, which means sometimes the theme will change (perhaps "
"significantly) without deprecation warnings or other alerts. Still, we "
"occasionally do warn about things like (upcoming) changes to the theme's "
"default config values. If you prefer *not* to receive such warnings, "
"there is a config value to suppress them:"
