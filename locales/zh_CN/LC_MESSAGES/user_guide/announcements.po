"You can specify an arbitrary URL that will be used as the HTML source for"
" your announcement. When the page is loaded, JavaScript will attempt to "
"fetch this HTML and insert it as-is into the announcement banner. This "

"multiple documentation sites or versions."

"If you set ``html_theme_options[\"announcement\"]`` to plain text or "

"If you set ``html_theme_options[\"announcement\"]`` to a URL string "
"(starts with ``http``), then you can edit the file at that URL to update "
"the announcement banner. Saving an empty file at that URL will remove the"
" announcement banner. That's the main advantage of using a URL--you can "
"change the announcement banner without rebuilding and redeploying all of "
"your documentation pages. For example, if you point the announcement to "
"the URL of a file in your repo, as we do on this documentation site (see "
"previous section), then you can edit, save and push your changes to just "
"that file (empty file = remove announcement) without rebuilding and "

"This functionality relies on the :ref:`version switcher <version-"

"If the active version compares less than the preferred version, the "
"announcement will inform the user that they are viewing an older version "
"of the documentation and provide a link to the preferred version. If the "
"version compares greater than the preferred version (or if the version "
"match contains the strings `\"dev\"`, `\"rc\"` or `\"pre\"`), the "
"announcement will say they are viewing an unstable development version "
"instead."

"If you want similar functionality for *older* versions of your docs (i.e."
" those built before the ``show_version_warning_banner`` configuration "
"option was available), you can manually add a banner by prepending the "

"``URL_OF_STABLE_VERSION_OF_PROJECT`` with a valid URL, and adjust styling"
