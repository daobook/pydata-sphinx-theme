"The theme includes the `FontAwesome 6 Free "
"<https://fontawesome.com/icons?m=free>`__ icon font (the ``.fa-solid, "
".fa-regular, .fa-brands`` styles, which are used for :ref:`icon links "
"<icon-links>` and admonitions). This is the only *vendored* font, and "
"otherwise, the theme by default relies on available system fonts for "
"normal body text and headers."

"If the font you want to specify in the section above is not generally "
"available by default, you will additionally need to ensure the font is "

"``_static`` directory of your Sphinx site, and then update the base "
"template to load the font resources:"

"Your text may quickly show up as \"unstyled\" before the fonts are "
"loaded. To reduce this, you may wish to explore options for `preloading "
"content <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-"
"US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content>`__, specifically the binary font "
"files. This ensures the files will be loaded before the CSS is parsed, "
