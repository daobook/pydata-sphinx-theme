"If a ``dict`` is specified, the keys can contain glob-style patterns; "
"page names which match the pattern will contain the sidebar templates "
"specified. This closely follows the behavior of the ``html_sidebars`` "
"option that is part of Sphinx itself, except that it operates on the "
"secondary sidebar instead of the primary sidebar. For more information, "
"see `the Sphinx documentation <https://www.sphinx-"
