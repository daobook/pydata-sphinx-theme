"The position of the search *button* is controlled by ``search-button`` "
"and by default is included in "
"``html_theme_options[\"navbar_persistent\"]``; you may move it elsewhere "
"as befits your site's layout, or remove it. You can also add an always-"
"visible search field to some/all pages in your site by adding ``search-"
"field.html`` to one of the configuration variables (e.g., "
"``html_sidebars``, ``html_theme_options[\"footer_start\"]``, etc.)."

"If a page includes *both* the search button and an always-visible search "
"field, the keyboard shortcuts will focus on the always-visible field and "
"the hidden search field overlay will not display. *This may not be what "
"you want:* on small screens (i.e. mobile devices) the sidebars may be "
"hidden in a drawer, and if the persistent search field is there, it may "
"receive focus without actually being made visible. It is **strongly "
"recommended** that you use *either* the search button and the "
"hidden/overlaid field that comes with it, *or* use a persistent search "
"field in a place that makes sense for your layout."
